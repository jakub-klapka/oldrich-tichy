<p>Oldřich Tichý was born on September 15, 1959 in Zlín, where he lived until 1980. His personality and art were shaped by his large and harmonious family, and also by stays at his grandparents’ in Tichov, near Valašské Klobouky. That contact with rural Moravia, and with the lives of the people there, who at that time were still living in close harmony with nature, had a great influence on the future artist, in whom the creative spirit was already awakening, and later that was powerfully reflected in his work.</p>

<p>Tichý attended The Secondary School of Applied Art in Uherské Hradiště, where he learnt the basics of various art techniques, and began to take more notice of general spiritual and social trends associated with art. In that respect, his meeting with the painter Zdeněk Matyáš during his first year at the school was influential.</p>

<p>After finishing secondary school, and before being accepted by the Academy of Fine Arts, Oldřich Tichý worked in a psychiatric hospital in Kroměříž as an art therapist. His first important paintings date from that time, and from the period immediately following it. They are, for the most part, expressively powerful works in the style of Rouault, displaying a preoccupation with and inspiration from extreme mental states.</p>

<p>Tichý studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, under Professor František Jiroudek. However, Tichý’s work diverged substantially from the style of his professor, and of other professors at the Academy. In essence he continued to develop his work from the preceding two years. In those largely figurative compositions, and in his new still lifes, he evidently abandoned his more or less intuitive and expressive style and focused on imaginative paintings, based on more rational principles of composition. In spring 1986, he took part in the 5th Confrontation Exhibition by the youngest generation of artists in Svárov.</p>

<p>An important period in Tichý’s life and work. His imaginative works, largely still lifes, began to approach metaphysical painting in their use of colour, form and composition, and in their overall atmosphere, although his style remained to some extent expressionist. Subsequently — after finishing his military service in 1987 — he concentrated on art again, and in 1988 the first compositions typical of his work began to appear, drawing on cultural and natural artefacts, with a multilayered symbolism in the powerful emotions and bizarre elements in the abstract surfaces of his paintings. An important role, in terms of the later development of his work, was also played by his decision to settle in a farmhouse in Dojetřice, near Sázava following the birth of his son. At that time he painted one of his key works, I Live Alone in the Woods Here. In October 1988 the first solo exhibition of his work was held at the Blatiny Arts Centre in Prague, with a catalogue that included an essay by Ivona Raimanová. In 1988 he became a member of the Mánes Association of Fine Artists. However, being part of an association was alien to him, and several years later he withdrew from Mánes.</p>

<p>In spring 1989 Oldřich Tichý, Tomáš Rossí, Ladislav Sorokáč, Lenka Vilhelmová and Petr Župník founded the Most (Bridge) group, and all exhibitions by the group included Tichý’s work.</p>

<p>In 1990 Tichý established regular contact with other countries, and a number of exhibitions of his work were held in Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands, at which a substantial number of paintings found their way into various collections, especially private ones. His visits to other countries allowed him to become better acquainted with developments in art in the west, and with classic works of modern art. Thanks to the National Gallery’s bold exhibition programme in the 1980s in Prague, he had already had an opportunity to see and admire the great Spanish painters (especially Antoni Tàpies and Antonio Saura), and he was now able to learn more about other figures in world art. The French painters Georges Rouault and Jean Dubuffet made a considerable impression on him. That discovery of the work of major European artists was also a source of support for his own art: his inventiveness become more relaxed, and his paintings made greater use of colour, and were more self-assured. He painted many important compositions.</p>

<p>Tichý won a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in New York. The grant allowed him to focus on his work more systematically, freeing him from material cares. He produced a number of objects in his studio in Dojetřice, which in some sense confirmed his earlier work, and anticipated his subsequent painting.</p>

<p>Paintings such as Window and Window into You indicated a certain shift in the ideas behind Tichý’s paintings, when he began to concentrate more than ever on painting itself. That was apparent in new and more profound psychological themes in his compositions (Behind You, 1999), and in his use of the surface and space of a painting, which was now free of all ties with an illusory reality. Now it was just space, or imaginary and pictorial spaces.</p>

<p>A major exhibition of Tichý’s work was held at the Václav Špála Gallery in Prague, titled Me and You, accompanied by his largest exhibition catalogue to date, with extensive reproductions, essays by Ivan Neumann and Jana Šálková, and an interview with Oldřich Tichý by the exhibition’s curator, Radan Wagner.</p>

<p>In recent years the paintings that have come out of Oldřich Tichý’s studio display a remarkable organic unity with all of his previous work, and explore the subject of the inner (spiritual) and outer worlds. They include his traditional robust, symbolic forms or “individualities” (Lying, 2004), but also compositions that evoke the abstract, the reality of the dynamics of life, multiplicity, eternity and the openness of natural and human existence (Sea, My Geometry, both 2006), or a confrontation between both aspects (A Path in the Labyrinth, 2001–2006).</p>
