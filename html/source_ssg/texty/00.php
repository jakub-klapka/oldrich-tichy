<p>
Lord, it is time. Let the great summer go,<br/>
Lay your long shadows on the sundials,<br/>
And over harvest piles let the winds blow.<br/>
Command the last fruits to be ripe;<br/>
Grant them some other southern hour,<br/>
Urge them to completion, and with power<br/>
Drive final sweetness to the heavy grape.<br/>
